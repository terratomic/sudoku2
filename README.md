# sudoku2

A WIP of a second remake of some old code!  
In spring of 2014, I created a desktop sudoku app.  
In summer of 2016, I ported some of that code and reworked it into a basic (and ugly) web app.  
Starting in winter/spring of 2017, I'm reworking my code (again!) from the summer into a new, more improved version.
